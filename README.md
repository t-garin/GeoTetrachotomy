# GeoTetrachotomy

_Representing Geographic Points Using Earth's Tetrachotomy_

main idea
-> represent geographic data using a number of tetrachotomy, subdivisions in 4 quadrants. 

example: 
-> 

why ? 
-> well it's fun + i believe it can lead to a very compact way of representing geopoints


why not other methods ?
-> well i'm pretty sure other methods such as using fractals of different shape n-chotometry could lead to more compact representation, but this one seems to be the easiest to implement

why julia
-> well i like it
